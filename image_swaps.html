			<br> 
			<br>
			<br>
			<p> A good suggestion for troops would be: 4 Healers, 24 Hogs, 9 Wizards, 4 Minions, 2 Rage spells, 2 Healing spells, and last in Clan Castle - 2 Poison spells + 5 Bowlers (CC)</p>
			<p> Drop the 4 Healers with your queen (use wizardas or rage if needed) and once some of buildings outside the wall have been destroyed use a healing spell with the hogs, drop the poison near the clan castle and heros once they target your troops. Use the rage to clear the town hall, then clear it up with the minions and anything else left over.</p>
